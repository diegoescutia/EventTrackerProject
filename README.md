## Lessons Learned


Implementation of REST interactions with JPA. Also keep improving my familiarity with MySQL Workbench, Postman, creating POJOs using JPA. Understanding how to send and receive JSON.

In the second part of the project, I learned how to dynamically add scripts to the application. 
Also, send asynchronous requests to Java controllers with JavaScript's `XMLHttpRequest, Consume and parse JSON responses with JavaScript. All request POST/PUT/DELETE requests were accomplished with XMLHttpRequest
